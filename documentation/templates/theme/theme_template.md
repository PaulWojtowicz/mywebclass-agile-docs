As a teacher at MyWebClass, I want to incorporate Agile methodologies in teaching modern software development technologies to provide students with a hands-on learning experience. By following Agile principles, we can quickly and effectively deliver project outcomes for our initiatives, which include creating a website that follows proper Search Engine Optimization and Google Analytics Integration, with a clean and simple design for ease of use, and implementing a CI/CD process to improve the workflow of development. This approach contextualizes technology with business processes, enabling our students to learn in a realistic and practical environment, preparing them for success in the tech industry.
