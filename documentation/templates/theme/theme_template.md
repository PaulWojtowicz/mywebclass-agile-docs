As a student, I want to have access to hands-on learning opportunities in modern software development technologies and processes so that I can build practical skills that are applicable in real-world scenarios. By creating interactive learning experiences, we can create a platform that provides students with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed in their future careers. This will enable us to empower the next generation of software developers and technology professionals. By following Agile principles and methodologies, we can quickly and effectively develop and deliver high-quality course materials and resources, setting our students up for success in the long term.
