# Initiative 3: CI/CD
Title of the Initiative: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Implementation

Description: Implement a CI/CD pipeline for the MyWebClass website to ensure smooth and efficient software development, testing, and deployment processes.

Goals:
- Improve software development speed and efficiency
- Increase software quality and reliability
- Automate software testing and deployment processes
- Improve team collaboration and communication

Scope: The scope of this initiative includes the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for the MyWebClass website, including code version control, automated testing, and continuous deployment to the production environment.

Outcomes:
- Faster and more efficient software development processes
- Higher software quality and reliability
- Automated software testing and deployment processes
- Improved team collaboration and communication

Deliverables:
- Implementation of a code version control system (e.g. Git)
- Integration of automated testing tools 
- Deployment pipeline automation using containerization (e.g. Docker)
- Regular reporting and analysis of pipeline performance

Milestones:
- Code version control implementation 
- Automated testing implementation 
- Deployment pipeline automation using containerization

Constraints:
- Technical limitations of the website platform

Assumptions:
T- eam members have basic knowledge of code version control and automated testing tools

Risks:
- Technical issues during implementation or deployment
- Incomplete or inaccurate testing results

Team:

CI/CD Engineer: responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the CI/CD pipeline
DevOps Engineer: responsible for the deployment and monitoring of the application in production environment
Web Developer: responsible for the development of the website features and components
Project Manager: responsible for overall project management and coordination.
