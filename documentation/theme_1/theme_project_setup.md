# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
Our project, MyWebClass, is a website that requires a development team to work together in parallel to produce various content that supports the objectives of the site. To start our project off using the "pull" approach to development, we will only focus on creating a basic web template that addresses any legal requirements that are relevant to our project, can be found using a search engine, allows us to legally use Google Analytics to measure user behavior on the site, and passes w3c validation, Lighthouse, GDPR Scanner.The following are three major pieces that the project will need to focus on:


Basic Project Documentation and Project Management:

-Define the project scope, goals, objectives, and deliverables.

-Identify the stakeholders and their requirements.

-Create a project plan that includes timelines, milestones, and dependencies.

-Set up communication channels and reporting mechanisms.

-Define the roles and responsibilities of the team members.

-Develop a risk management plan to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks.

Tools that can be used:
Trello or Asana for project management and task tracking
Google Docs or Microsoft Office for document collaboration
Slack or Microsoft Teams for communication and collaboration
JIRA or TFS for issue tracking and bug reporting
Gantt chart software such as Microsoft Project or GanttProject for project scheduling and tracking


DevOps:

-Select and implement the appropriate DevOps tools and practices that support the development of the project, such as version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and automated testing.

-Establish a development pipeline that automates the software delivery process, from code commit to deployment.

-Define a release management process that ensures the quality and stability of the product before release.

-Set up a monitoring and logging system that provides insights into the performance and usage of the website.

-Define a disaster recovery plan that ensures the continuity of the project in the event of a catastrophic failure.

Tools that can be used:
Git or SVN for version control
Jenkins or CircleCI for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
Docker or Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration
Ansible or Chef for infrastructure automation and configuration management
New Relic or Datadog for application performance monitoring (APM) and logging



MyWebClass.org base website template with all technical and legal requirements satisfied to use Google Analytics and be appropriately listed in a search engine by implementing the basic on page SEO requirements.

-Develop a website template that meets the defined requirements, such as legal compliance, Google Analytics integration, and validation standards.

-Implement basic on-page SEO requirements to ensure the website can be appropriately listed in search engines.

-Test the website template thoroughly to ensure it meets the defined requirements and is user-friendly.

-Launch the initial 0.1.0 release of the website template and continue to iterate based on user feedback and data insights gathered through Google Analytics.

Tools that can be used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development
WordPress or Drupal for content management systems (CMS)
Google Analytics for web analytics and user behavior tracking
Yoast SEO or All in One SEO Pack for on-page SEO optimization
W3C Markup Validation Service or Lighthouse for website validation and performance testing


By executing this plan, the project team can successfully create a MyWebClass.org website template that meets all technical and legal requirements to use Google Analytics and can be appropriately listed in search engines. The DevOps process ensures that the project is efficiently managed and that the website is continuously delivered with high quality and stability.

## Initiative(s)
