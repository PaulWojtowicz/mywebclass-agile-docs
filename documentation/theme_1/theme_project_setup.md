# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
Our project, MyWebClass, is a website that requires a development team to work together in parallel to produce various content that supports the objectives of the site. To start our project off using the "pull" approach to development, we will only focus on creating a basic web template that addresses any legal requirements that are relevant to our project, can be found using a search engine, allows us to legally use Google Analytics to measure user behavior on the site, and passes w3c validation, Lighthouse, GDPR Scanner.The following are three major pieces that the project will need to focus on:


Basic Project Documentation and Project Management:

-Define the project scope, goals, objectives, and deliverables.

-Identify the stakeholders and their requirements.

-Create a project plan that includes timelines, milestones, and dependencies.

-Set up communication channels and reporting mechanisms.

-Define the roles and responsibilities of the team members.

-Develop a risk management plan to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks.




Tools that can be used:
Trello or Asana for project management and task tracking
Google Docs or Microsoft Office for document collaboration
Slack or Microsoft Teams for communication and collaboration
JIRA or TFS for issue tracking and bug reporting
Gantt chart software such as Microsoft Project or GanttProject for project scheduling and tracking


DevOps:

-Select and implement the appropriate DevOps tools and practices that support the development of the project, such as version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and automated testing.

-Establish a development pipeline that automates the software delivery process, from code commit to deployment.

-Define a release management process that ensures the quality and stability of the product before release.

-Set up a monitoring and logging system that provides insights into the performance and usage of the website.

-Define a disaster recovery plan that ensures the continuity of the project in the event of a catastrophic failure.

Tools that can be used:
Git or SVN for version control
Jenkins or CircleCI for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
Docker or Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration
Ansible or Chef for infrastructure automation and configuration management
New Relic or Datadog for application performance monitoring (APM) and logging

Metrics to track success:
User engagement metrics: These could include metrics such as time spent on site, bounce rate, and pages per session. By tracking these metrics, the project team can identify areas of the site that are performing well and areas that may need improvement in order to keep users engaged and on the site.

Conversion metrics: Depending on the goals of the site, the project team may want to track conversion metrics such as sign-ups, purchases, or other actions that indicate users are taking desired actions on the site. By tracking these metrics, the team can identify areas of the site that may need to be optimized to improve conversion rates.

Traffic sources: By tracking where traffic to the site is coming from (such as search engines, social media, or referral sites), the project team can better understand how to target their marketing efforts and where to focus their resources.

Performance metrics: These could include metrics such as page load times, server response times, and error rates. By tracking these metrics, the team can identify areas of the site that may need to be optimized for speed and performance in order to improve the user experience.

Bug and issue tracking: By keeping track of bugs and issues that are reported by users or discovered through testing, the project team can prioritize and address these issues to ensure that the site is functioning as intended and providing a good user experience.



MyWebClass.org base website template with all technical and legal requirements satisfied to use Google Analytics and be appropriately listed in a search engine by implementing the basic on page SEO requirements.

-Develop a website template that meets the defined requirements, such as legal compliance, Google Analytics integration, and validation standards.

-Implement basic on-page SEO requirements to ensure the website can be appropriately listed in search engines.

-SEO Requirements:
Optimized title tags and meta descriptions: These HTML elements provide a concise summary of the page's content, which helps search engines and users understand what the page is about. Optimizing them can improve click-through rates and relevance signals for search engine ranking.

Proper header hierarchy: Using header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) correctly can help search engines and users understand the structure and hierarchy of the content on the page. This can improve readability and relevance signals for search engine ranking.

Descriptive and unique URLs: URLs that reflect the content of the page can improve user experience and help search engines understand what the page is about. Including relevant keywords in the URL can also provide additional relevance signals for search engine ranking.

Image optimization: Optimizing images with descriptive file names, alt tags, and proper sizes can improve page load times, user experience, and relevance signals for search engine ranking.

Mobile responsiveness: With the increasing use of mobile devices, it is crucial to ensure that the website template is mobile-friendly and responsive. This can improve user experience and provide additional relevance signals for search engine ranking.

Implementing these basic on-page SEO requirements can help improve the visibility, relevance, and user experience of MyWebClass.org website template, which can lead to increased traffic and engagement from search engine users.

-Test the website template thoroughly to ensure it meets the defined requirements and is user-friendly.

-Launch the initial 0.1.0 release of the website template and continue to iterate based on user feedback and data insights gathered through Google Analytics.

Tools that can be used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development
WordPress or Drupal for content management systems (CMS)
Google Analytics for web analytics and user behavior tracking
Yoast SEO or All in One SEO Pack for on-page SEO optimization
W3C Markup Validation Service or Lighthouse for website validation and performance testing


By executing this plan, the project team can successfully create a MyWebClass.org website template that meets all technical and legal requirements to use Google Analytics and can be appropriately listed in search engines. The DevOps process ensures that the project is efficiently managed and that the website is continuously delivered with high quality and stability.

Risks
Identify Risks: The project team will conduct a risk assessment to identify all potential risks to the project. This assessment will include a review of historical data, industry best practices, and input from project team members and stakeholders.

Assess Risks: Once all potential risks have been identified, the project team will assess the likelihood and impact of each risk. This assessment will be based on historical data, industry best practices, and input from project team members and stakeholders.

Prioritize Risks: After assessing the likelihood and impact of each risk, the project team will prioritize risks based on their severity and the likelihood of occurrence. This prioritization will help the project team to focus on the most critical risks first.

Mitigate Risks: To mitigate risks, the project team will develop a risk mitigation plan that outlines specific actions to be taken to minimize the likelihood or impact of each identified risk. The project team will also assign responsibilities for implementing the risk mitigation plan and establish timelines for completion.

Monitor Risks: Throughout the project lifecycle, the project team will continually monitor and assess the risks to the project. This will allow the project team to identify new risks as they arise and adjust the risk mitigation plan as necessary.

## Test plan
Create a playwright test for all legal requirements:
The development team can create automated tests using playwright to ensure that the website template meets all legal requirements, such as GDPR compliance, accessibility, and copyright infringement.
The team can write test cases for each requirement and execute the tests to ensure that the website passes all legal compliance requirements.
Test that Google Analytics is tracking MyWebClass.org:
The development team can create a test case to verify that Google Analytics is properly tracking user behavior on the website.
The team can create a unique event or pageview in Google Analytics and ensure that it is being tracked when a user interacts with the website.
The team can also verify that Google Analytics is properly configured and implemented on the website by checking the analytics code and tracking tags.
Once the tests are created, they can be executed using an automated testing tool such as Selenium or by manually running the tests on different browsers and devices. The results of the tests can be recorded and analyzed to identify any issues or bugs in the website template or analytics implementation. Any issues or bugs that are identified can be fixed by the development team, and the tests can be re-executed to ensure that the issues have been resolved. The process of testing and fixing issues can be repeated until the website template meets all defined requirements and is ready for launch.
